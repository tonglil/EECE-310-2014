STORY 7 â€“ UNDO:
As a player,
I want to be able to undo a move I regret, including all ghost moves made since my previous move;
So that I can continue the game in the state just before my last move.

  if the Pacman ate anything:
    the food is put back,
    points are reversed,
  the ghosts undo position to one time unit ago.

  and the Pacman's previous action was 'move right';
When I press undo;

    points are reversed,
  the ghosts undo position to one time unit ago.

Scenario S7.3: Undo No-movement
Given the game is suspended,
  and the Pacman's previous action was 'no-movement';
When I press undo;
Then the Pacman does not move,
  the ghosts undo position to one time unit ago.

Scenario S7.4: Undo Up

    and the Pacman's previous action is moving up,

Given the pacman die;
When I press undo;
Then my Pacman back to its place before it dies,
  and points go back if my Pacman ate anything,
  and food puts back if my Pacman ate it,
  and the ghosts move back to the place before my Pacman dies.

Scenario S7.7: The player undos
When the pacman/ghost move,
Then the x-y location of the pacman/ghost will be recorded in an array.
When the player presses "undo",
Then everything will be returned to their location at that point.

Scenario S7.8: The player redos
Given that I have undone one or more moves,
  and that I have not made any new moves since;
When I redo;
Then the state of the game will progress forwards to redo the undone action.

Scenario S7.9: The player redos through history
When a move being undone occurs,
  and a history of moves is tracked;
Then the player can step through the history,
  and redo their undone moves.
